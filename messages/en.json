      "about_country_text1": "Kazakhstan’s true magic lies not only in its vastness, but in its contrasts — where silence meets strength, and ancient traditions meet modern ambition. Venture beyond the urban skylines of Astana and Almaty, and you’ll discover a world sculpted by wind, time, and nomadic pride. The boundless steppe isn’t just a landscape — it’s a symbol of freedom that has shaped generations of resilient, welcoming people.",
      "about_country_text2": "In every village, you'll find stories passed down around the fire. In every traditional yurt, a connection to the past. The Kazakh way of life is deeply rooted in respect for nature, hospitality, and courage — whether you're sharing fermented kumis with a herder or climbing snow-covered peaks in the Tien Shan. This is a land for wanderers, dreamers, and anyone yearning to reconnect with something pure, powerful, and timeless.",

Here, rugged beauty and raw nature create a backdrop like no other in Central Asia. With over 90% of the country covered in mountains, this is where trekkers, dreamers, and seekers of solitude find their path.",
      "about_country_text2": "But Tajikistan is not only wilderness — it is warmth. In remote villages, hospitality is a way of life. Chai is shared, stories are offered, and traditions are kept alive in dances, fabrics, and festivals. Whether you’re tracing the Wakhan Corridor or wandering the vibrant markets of Dushanbe, every step here connects you with something ancient, soulful, and utterly unforgettable.",

      "about_country_text1": "But Kyrgyzstan is more than scenery — it's a living legacy of the nomadic soul. In the vast jailoo (summer pastures), families still herd their animals as they have for generations. Travelers are not strangers here — they are guests, welcomed with a bowl of warm kumis and heartfelt hospitality that knows no boundaries. Sharing stories under the stars, listening to the music of komuz, and tasting bread baked in clay tandyrs — this is everyday life, as rich as the land itself.",
      "about_country_text2": "But Kyrgyzstan is more than scenery — it's a living culture. In the high pastures (jailoo), families still herd livestock and welcome travelers with open arms and warm kumis.

Once home to mighty empires like Parthia and Khwarezm, this country holds the ruins of Merv and Nisa, whispering stories of traders, scholars, and civilizations that shaped the Silk Road.",
      "about_country_text2": "But beyond the history lies a living culture: proud, resilient, and welcoming. In traditional villages, carpets are still handwoven with centuries-old symbolism; in the vast Karakum Desert, yurts still dot the horizon. The blazing Darvaza Gas Crater — “The Door to Hell” — lights up the night like a torch from the underworld. Hospitality here is sacred — tea is shared, stories are offered, and visitors are treated as honored guests. Turkmenistan isn’t just a destination — it’s a revelation waiting to unfold, for the curious and the courageous.",
